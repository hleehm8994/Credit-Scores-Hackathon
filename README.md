# Credit-Rating-Prediction
forecasting model served to predict the credit rating
#According to the model, the approval system stressed placing more difficulty to approve customers with a Low requested credit amount
since they are not required to put up collateral in response to a smaller requested amount. In contrast, customers with
a High requested credit amount have an easier time getting approved as the bank requires them to put personal assets
as a collateral hedge against the default.
